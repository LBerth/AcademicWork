# AcademicWork
Some of the academic work I did during my 3-years engineering school at ISAE-Supaero.

## Medical Data Analysis

The exam of our statistics class consisted in analyzing some medical data in a python notebook. We had to use different statistical tools to find the variable that explained the best the progression of a disease.

## Stochastic approximation

This is the work I submitted for my exam of Machine Learning class. It consisted in writing a notebook explaining a subject related to Machine Learning. I worked on Stochastic Approximation and Stochastic Gradient Descent which is a fundamental notion to understand how neural networks work.

## Artificial Bee Colony

This is a notebook that I did for my Metaheuristic class, explaining the Artificial Bee Colony algorithm. It is a king of population based algorithm, like genetic algorithms, that can be used to optimize complex functions.

## Eulerian Tours

For my graph theory class, I had to implement an algorithm to find Eulerian tours in a graph. A Eulerian tour is a cycle that goes through every vertex of the graph exactly one time.
